#Matrix RGB Project
This project was completed for the purposes of the university of Paisii Hilendarski as part of the 
<b>Python Programming</b> selective
##Goal
The goal of this project is to calculate the longest adjacent route of the same color in a 2D matrix
##How to use
Simply execute`main.py` with a compiler of your own choice

Inside the file you'll also notice there are 2 modes of execution:
- Automatically, using a file (in this case - `input.txt`, located right next to the `main.py` file)
- Manually, using console input

These modes can be changed, using the `readFile` parameter of the function `gen_input()`
By default the mode should be on console input
